Hypothesis testing

p_Value-> prob(data | H0 is True)
alpha -> significance level
if(p_Value < alpha):
	rejrct H0
else:
	accept H0
	
when population std is known then use z-test

when population std is not known then use t-test(population < 30)

KS Test

H0 : Two distribution are same.
Ha : Two distribution are different.

Kolmogorov–Smirnov test a very efficient way to determine if two samples are significantly different from each other.



There is an issue with Student’s T-Test, samples must be normal (shaped in a normal distribution). That is an issue for us because we do work a lot with Poisson distributions.

Chi-sqauare test assumptions

H0 : feature is independent
Ha : feature is dependent

1. Variable categorical
2. Observation independent 
3. each cell mutually excusive
4. Expected(EXP) value in each cell > 5


ANOVA
Higher F ratio values indicate the variation between groups is larger than the individual variation of groups. In such cases, it is more likely that the mean of the groups are different.

Assumption for ANOVA
1. Normality - > must follow normal distribution
2. Independent
3. Equal Sample varience.

IF ANOVA FAILS THEN USE KRUSKAL WALLIS TEST
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in four mixing techniques.

Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in four mixing techniques.

Mann Whitney U Test alternative of two sample t-test.
