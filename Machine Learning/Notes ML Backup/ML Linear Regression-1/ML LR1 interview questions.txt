Explain the Assumptions of Linear Regression.

Discuss the key assumptions, such as linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.
How Do You Interpret the Coefficients in a Linear Regression Model?

Understand how the coefficients relate to the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable.
What is the Purpose of the Cost Function in Linear Regression?

Explain the role of the cost function (or loss function) in the context of linear regression and how it is minimized during training.
How Would You Handle Categorical Variables in Linear Regression?

Discuss techniques for encoding categorical variables, such as one-hot encoding or label encoding, and their implications in linear regression.
What is the Difference Between Gradient Descent and Normal Equation in the Context of Linear Regression?

Compare the two methods for finding the optimal parameters in linear regression and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.
How Can You Detect and Handle Outliers in a Linear Regression Model?

Explain methods for identifying outliers and discuss the impact of outliers on linear regression. Mention techniques like removing outliers or using robust regression.
Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff.

Discuss the concept of bias and variance in the context of model performance and how it relates to underfitting and overfitting.
What is Regularization, and Why is it Important in Linear Regression?

Describe regularization techniques like Ridge and Lasso, and explain how they help prevent overfitting in linear regression models.
How Would You Assess the Goodness of Fit of a Linear Regression Model?

Discuss metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model.
Can You Explain the Concept of Multicollinearity? How Does it Affect Linear Regression?

Define multicollinearity and discuss its impact on the stability of coefficients in multiple linear regression models.
Give an Example of a Real-world Scenario Where Linear Regression Could be Applied.

Demonstrate your understanding of applying linear regression to solve practical problems, such as predicting sales based on advertising spending.
How Does Feature Scaling Impact Linear Regression?

Discuss the importance of feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization) in linear regression and its effect on the convergence of optimization algorithms.
Explain the Difference Between Overfitting and Underfitting in the Context of Linear Regression.

Provide examples of overfitting and underfitting, and discuss strategies to mitigate these issues.
